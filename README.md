Based on the summarized content from the paper titled "LONG LORA: EFFICIENT FINE-TUNING CONTEXT LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS", here are the key points:

1. **Abstract and Introduction**:
   - The paper introduces LongLoRA, an efficient method for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to extend their context sizes without significant computational costs.
   - Training LLMs with long context sizes is usually computationally expensive. LongLoRA addresses this by using sparse local attention during fine-tuning and dense global attention during inference.
   - LongLoRA has been tested on various tasks and models, demonstrating strong results.
   - The paper also introduces a dataset, LongQA, for supervised fine-tuning containing over 3k long context question-answer pairs.
   - The code, models, dataset, and demo are available on GitHub.

2. **Background**:
   - Large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA and LLaMA2 have predefined context sizes which limit their application in tasks like summarizing long documents or answering long questions.
   - The paper discusses the computational challenges of training LLMs with longer contexts and the inefficiencies of existing methods.
   - The paper introduces the concept of shift short attention (S2-Attn) as an efficient substitute for standard self-attention.

3. **LongLoRA Design**:
   - LongLoRA introduces shift short attention during fine-tuning but retains the original standard self-attention during inference.
   - The paper emphasizes the importance of trainable embedding and normalization layers for long context learning, even though they constitute a small proportion of the model's parameters.

4. **Related Work**:
   - The paper discusses various methods developed to increase the context length of transformers.
   - It also touches upon other efficient fine-tuning methods and their relevance to the current research.

5. **Shift Short Attention**:
   - The paper delves into the details of the proposed shift short attention mechanism, explaining its design and advantages over standard self-attention.
